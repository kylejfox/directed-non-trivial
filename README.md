Shortest non-trivial cycles in directed surface graphs (tentative title). By Jeff Erickson and Kyle Fox.



Abstract: Let G be an edge-weighted directed graph with n vertices embedded on a surface of genus g. We describe algorithms to efficiently compute shortest non-separating and non-contractible cycles in G.
